/**
 * @file doca_gpunetio_signal.h
 * @brief A header file for the doca_gpunetio rank-local signal map
 *
 * A signal map resolves the signal id carried in the immediate of an
 * RDMA_WRITE_WITH_IMM into an 8-byte slot in GPU memory, and adds the signal value to it.
 *
 * None of these calls are thread-safe, and delivery assumes a single writer.
 *
 * Delivery - doca_gpu_verbs_rq_progress() or a service given the map with
 * doca_gpu_verbs_service_set_signal_map() - reads the map without a lock. The caller owns the
 * map's lifecycle: it must not register, unregister, or destroy while a signal may be delivered
 * into the map.
